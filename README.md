Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a framework for building website user interfaces, but it’s different from other frameworks like Bootstrap because it doesn’t provide ready-made templates. Instead, it offers small utility classes that let you control every part of the design (colors, sizes, fonts, spacing, etc.).
This means that instead of writing CSS manually, you directly write class names inside your HTML.

## Benefits

1-Faster Development
Instead of spending time writing long CSS files, you use ready-made utility classes to apply designs quickly.

2-Full Control
Gives you the freedom to choose colors, spacing, sizes, etc., without being limited to a predefined template.

3-Clean and Organized Code
All styling classes stay within the same HTML element, reducing the need for separate CSS files.

4-Responsive by Default
Supports designs that adapt easily to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

5-Highly Customizable
You can modify the configuration file to change colors, fonts, and even add your own custom classes.
